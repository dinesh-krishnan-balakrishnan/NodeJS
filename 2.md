# Using Git and GitHub

## Git

__Download:__ git-scm.com

Git is a very popular version control system designed to keep track of project changes with speed and efficiency. In essence, it keeps track of various versions of the same software, for posteriority or backtracking to a previous stage of development.
_NOTE:_ If not using a Linux OS, use the Git Bash terminal application to ensure commands work.

### Version

```bash
    git --version 
```

Displays the current version of Git installed on the system.

### Initializing Git

```bash
    git init
```

Initializes a Git repository in the current directory. Creates a .git sub-directory to track and manage project changes.

### Current File Status

```bash
    git status
```

Gives details about the files in the current Git-initialized directory.  Informs of whether a file is untracked, unstaged, or staged. Untracked files aren't being tracked by the Git software, while the changes in unstaged files are. Staged files are the files that are going to be grouped into the next commit (version).

### Staging Files

```bash
    git add . (or filename/pathname filename/pathname...)
```

Stages untracked and unstaged files.

### Committing Files

```bash
    git commit -m "Message"
```

Takes all staged changes and bundles them into a single commit, keeping track of all changes made in the commit.

**NOTE:** To prevent certain files or directories from ever being tracked by Git, create a .gitignore file. Each line in this file should contain a 'filename' or 'pathname/'. These contents won't be staged or committed.

## GitHub

_Note:_ GitHub is an extension of Git, so the only software pre-requisite is to download Git.

### Adding an SSH Key

In order to connect to GitHub, a secure connection must be made first using a public SSH key. This key needs to be given to
GitHub by going to:

> Settings -> SSH and GPG Keys -> New SSH Key

### Logging In & Linking a Project

After giving the public SSH key to GitHub, the user needs to authenticate to the server. First, the account-related information needs to be configured within Git:

```bash
    git config --global user.email <E-Mail Account>
    git config --global user.name <GitHub Username>
``` 

Once the account information is specified, a GitHub repo can be accessed through **clone**:

```bash
    git clone <HTTPS Repo URL>
```

When initially cloning, GitHub will prompt you for your GitHub password. Once authenticated, the GitHub repo will be initialized in the current directory. 

### Accessing & Modifying the GitHub Repo

```bash
    git pull
    git push
```

To change the local directory to match the GitHub repository, the __git pull__ command should be executed. Alternatively, the __git push__ command should be called to change the GitHub repository to match the local directory.

### GitHub Commits

Simply using the **git commit** command will not alter the GitHub repository; the staged files need to be commited to the GitHub origin:

```bash
    git commit origin master
```

Once the files are commited to the origin branch of the current project, the GitHub repository can be changed by calling **git push**.
