# Debugging With V8

V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by The Chromium Project for Google Chrome. Eventually, the engine was used by NodeJS to help JS run outside of web browsers. It offers a great debugging tool through Google Chrome.

## Code Setup

```JavaScript
    let x = 5;

    debugger

    console.log(y);
```

The __debugger__ command is key to using the V8 Chrome debugger. It doesn't do anything when code is executed normally, but will stop the Chrome debugger at the position it is placed in. Multiple __debugger__ commands will create multiple breakpoints within the code.

## Terminal Commands

```bash
    node inspect filename
    node --inspect-brk filename.
```

Starts the debugger for the specified program. The __--inspect-brk__ tag will need to be used if _inspect_ isn't working on the machine; this seems to be an error for Windows users only.

```bash
    restart
```

If the debugger is accessed and closed in Chrome, it can easily be restarted by typing __restart__.

## Accessing the Debugger

Once _node inspect_ has been executed by the terminal, the debugger can be accessed by typing in the Chrome browser window:

> chrome://inspect

From here, the user can click on _inspect_ in the window for the related target. The console can be used to execute commands during runtime, plus the Call Stack and program variables can be viewed. Pressing the play button will stop the program at each __debugger__ statement.
