# Using MongoDB & Robo3t

## Definitions:

* **NoSQL:** Stands for _Not Only Structured Query Language_. SQL databases store data strictly as a table, with each element having to contain and only contain the specified properties. With NoSQL, each element can have any property assigned to it.

* **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database. Provides NodeJS users with a NPM module to easily use its database.

* **CRUD:** Stands for _Create, Read, Update, Delete_. These are the 4 basic defined functions for storage management.

## Key Terms

__Database:__ Contains a group of tables/collections. A single database would be used for a single project, but individual
tables/collections would store information for a part of the project.

| SQL        | NoSQL      | Function                                            |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Table      | Collection | The storage type that contains a group of elements. |

## Setting Up MongoDB

1. Go to MongoDB.com and download the MongoDB compressed file.

2. Extract the contents of the downloaded file and move it to a preferable storage location.

3. Create another directory to store the data that will be managed by MongoDB. (Database)

4. Execute the following command to run the MongoDB executable and link the data directory:
```bash
    <MongoDB Directory Pathname>/bin/mongod --dbpath=<MongoDB Database Directory>
```

5. The server is set up and locally hosted, running on MongoDB's default port **27017**. To access the server, use:

> mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017

**127.0.0.1** is the default IP address on most networking systems.

## Using Robo3t

Robo3t is a GUI application used to easily view the contents of MongoDB collections. To use it:

1. Go to robomongo.org and install the application. 

2. During startup, the program will ask for the a server's location to create a connection. If the server is running on the machine at the default location, the address will most likely be **localhost: 27017**.

3. Once the connection is setup, the server's contents can be viewed. Right click on a collection and select 'View Documents' to view its data.
