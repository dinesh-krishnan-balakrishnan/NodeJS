# Setting up the Production Environment

## Environment Variables

Instead of specifying variables in each file, it is better to set up environment variables. That said, different operating systems have different syntax to store these environment variables. An NPM package exists to fix this: env-cmd.

__Download:__ npm i env-cmd

With the package installed, the programmer can specify __KEY=value__ pairs in each line of an .env file.

```env
    KEY=value
    KEY=value
```

These pairs can then be used on a program by running the following command:

```bash
    env-cmd ./env-file.env normal-command
```

The normal-command will run with its environment variables being set to those specified in the env-file. To access an environment variable through JavaScript:

```javascript
process.env.ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_KEY
```

## Environment Variables in Heroku

To set up environment variables in Heroku:

```bash
    heroku config:set <key>=<value> <key>=<value>...
```

To remove variables:

```bash
    heroku config:unset <key> <key> ...
```

## MongoDB Atlas & Compass

__Atlas:__ https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
__Compass:__ https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass

__MongoDB Atlas__ is a cloud database that handles the entire setup for its clients. It is helpful for using a database that is compatible with production servers such as _Heroku_. __MongoDB Compass__ is a GUI that is useful for visualizing MongoDB databases similar to __Robo3t__, but also has the ability to connect to the __MongoDB Atlas__ databases. To setup the database:

1. Create a MongoDB Atlas account.
2. Create a _cluster_. A _cluster_ is the term used to represent a cloud-based database. 
3. Connect to the _cluster:_:
   1. Specify an IP address of __0.0.0.0/0__. This will use the default IP address specified within the hosting machine.
   2. Specify a _username_ and _password_ for connecting to the cluster.
4. Use the _username_, _password_, and _hosting URL_ to connect to the _cluster_ through __MongoDB Compass__.

From here, the server code can connect to MongoDB by using the SRV address provided through _Atlas_. It is recommended to use a MongoDB database for development and an Atlas cluster for production.

## SendGrid

SendGrid is an API that allows a server to send e-mails to the client users. Connecting to the service requires an API key, which requires the user to make a SendGrid account and validate it through __Single Sender Verification__ in the _Settings_ menu.

__Download:__ npm i @sendgrid/mail

From here, sending an email is pretty straightforward:

```javascript
    //Note: The API key is being stored as an environment variable.
    sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.API_KEY);

    sgMail.send({
        to: 'example@gmail.com',
        from: 'example@gmail.com',
        subject: 'First SendGrid Email',
        text: 'Hello, \nThis is an email message. \nThank you, \nDinesh'
    })
```
