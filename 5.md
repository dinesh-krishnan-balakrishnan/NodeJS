# Using SSH Keys to Access Heroku

## Creating SSH (Secure Shell) Keys

SSH keys are very important access credential used to establish a secure connection between a system and a remote server. They can be used to establish a connection with services such as GitHub and Heroku.

### Creating a Key

```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "comment (usually email)"
```

__ssh-keygen__ creates SSH keys. If wanted, the directory in which these keys will be stored can be changed and an extra layer of security can be added with a passphrase; this will be prompted during the command execution. For the current SSH key, the _type_ is RSA and the _byte_ size is 4096. 

### Viewing the Key Directory

```bash
    ls -la ~/.ssh
```

This can be used to view the default keys directory. Keys manually created in other directories don't appear here. 

### Viewing the Key

```bash
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Lists the public key that can be shared with external sources. This is assuming the key is generated in the default SSH key directory. 

### Single Sign-On

```bash
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

The ssh-agent is a helper program that keeps track of user identity keys and passphrases. Combined with the __eval__ program, it outputs commands to set certain environment variables in the shell. The ssh-add command then adds the private key(s) into the SSH authentication agent. These two methods together set up single sign-on (SSO), a system that allows an user to sign in only once to gain access to many servers.

## Heroku

__Download:__ https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install

Heroku is a cloud platform service allowing for the hosting of applications through their own servers. It differs from services such as _Google Cloud_ and _AWS_ because it offers a ready-to-use environment allowing for fast code deployment. 

### Version

```bash
    heroku -v
```

Displays the current version of Heroku.

### Logging In

```bash
    heroku login
```

By typing the command above, Heroku will open a tab in the browser asking whether the user wants to login. Once confirmed, the user will be logged in through the Heroku CLI (Command Line Interface).

### Adding an SSH Key

```bash
    heroku keys:add
```

Searches for and adds the public key to the Heroku servers. This is an automated process.

### Linking a Project

```bash
    heroku create <project-name>
```

Once the project is created, it is necessary to specify the start file that Heroku should use. This can be done by navigating to _package.json_ and adding a start attribute to _"scripts"_. The attribute should be specified as:

```bash
    "start": "node <filename>"
```

The last thing to change is the port number, as this is a value that Heroku itself provides. This can be changed to:

```javascript
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```

...where 3000 is a fallback port in case Heroku isn't be used to run the code.

### Updating the Heroku Code Base

```bash
    git push heroku master
```

Changes the Heroku code base to match the local directory.
