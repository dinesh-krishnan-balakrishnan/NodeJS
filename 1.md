# Node Terminal Commands

Node.js is a Javascript-based environment used to create web-servers and networked applications. Once installed, it gives plenty more added functionality to an operating system's command line. 

## Version

```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
```

The __version__ tag displays the version of Node and NPM (Node Package Manager).

## Node Runtime

```bash
    node
```

By simply typing the __node__ command, the REPL (Read eValuate Print Loop) starts. The REPL is an interactive top-level shell that takes in single line user inputs, evaluates them, and then returns the result to the user. 

## Global and Process

```bash
    global
    process
    process.exit()
```

While in the REPL, the __global__ and __process__ variable content can be returned by simply typing their name. __global__ contains the global object, while __process__ gives us various commands for the REPL process that is running. One of its properties is the exit command that stops the REPL.

## Executing Node Files

```bash
    node filename
    node filename --argument="value" ...
```
This simply runs the specified file using the node runtime. Arguments can be passed into the executable by including them after the filename.

## Initializing the NPM

```bash
    npm init
    npm init -y
```

Initializes the NPM for use within the current directory. This creates a _package.json_ file that contains the details of the current project. The user is prompted about, but they are automatically generated by default. The prompt can be bypassed by using the _yes_ flag.

## Installing NPM Packages

```bash
    npm install package
    npm i package
    npm i package@1.0.0
    npm i package -g
    npm i package --save-dev
```

The NPM gets its packages from the npmjs.com web server. The _i_ flag is just an alias for _install_. A specified version of the package can be installed using the @ symbol. To install a package globally for all projects, use the _global_ flag. Lastly, adding the _save-dev_ flag will install the corresponding package during development but will not install in production servers.

## Installing Missing Packages

```bash
    npm install
    npm i
```

_package-lock.json_ is similar to _package.json_, except it helps prevent package version issues encountered with team projects. If a node_modules directory containing all packages is missing but _package-lock_ and _package_ exist, the directory can be recreated with the above commands.

## Uninstalling Packages

```bash
    npm uninstall package
    npm uninstall -g package
```

The _global_ flag will uninstall the global version of a package. 

## Nodemon

```bash
    npm i nodemon -g
    nodemon filename
    nodemon filename -e extension,extension
```

__nodemon__ is a very helpful package that automatically re-runs a program as soon as edits are made and saved. This saves the hassle
of having to execute the node command again and again, even for just simple edits. __nodemon__ restarts whenever a JS file is saved, but this can be changed with the _extension_ tag.

>**EX:** nodemon example.js -e js,hbs

## Scripts

```javascript
    "dev": "nodemon app.js -e hbs, js"
```

The _package.json_ file has an attribute titled __scripts__. In this attribute, the user can specify sub-attributes that tie node terminal scripts to a simple command. Based on the above code, the entire Nodemon statement can executed by typing:

```bash
    node run dev
```
